# Count words

This repo is for counting words in a wsp conversation. 

## how to run
Just download the conversation as txt file and save it in the folder as 'chat.txt'. Then you can run as: 

```
python words.py
```
The algorithm will output the 30 most used words (of lenght bigger that 3), without considering numbers. And also the amount of times the word happy was said.
